// Package inert makes text from outside the runtime inert for a terminal
// (ADR-0024): the control characters a terminal would act on are removed,
// and nothing else is.
//
// It removes characters, never sequence bodies. Every terminal control
// begins with ESC or a C1 introducer, so once those are gone nothing left
// can start a sequence, and what was a body is ordinary text. Stripping a
// whole sequence would hide text: an OSC that is never terminated runs to
// the end of the string, and in an approval dialog that is the rest of the
// command — the spoof the terminal itself performs (measured, ADR-0024).
//
// The callers are the ingresses — the TUI's messages and callbacks, and the
// plain entrances' terminal streams — plus the one thing downstream that can
// make a control out of text with none: the output of a transform over it
// (Styled). internal/archtest pins the callers.
