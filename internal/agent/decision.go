// Decision is the one reading of a tool call that every gate shares
// (gem-agent ADR-0073 §4): whether the call changes state, and what the rule
// tier says about it. Three places once computed this separately —
// the session-allowlist floor, the auto ladder and the policy gate —
// and each missed a floor the others had (gem-agent ADR-0072 §1.1, §4.5, §4.9).
// The architecture test pins risk.Classify to this file.

	// OverCeiling is set when the session's lane ceiling is below the
	// lane this call's effect needs (gem-agent ADR-0080 §3). It is a refusal, not
	// an escalation: the gate can be answered by the session allowlist,
	// so a ceiling that escalated would be a ceiling an earlier 'a'
	// could spend. CeilingReason is the operator-facing why.
	OverCeiling bool
	// CeilingReason is the model-facing why, in English like every other
	// tool result. CeilingKind is the same fact machine-readable, so the

	// server runs outside every Seatbelt profile and whose effects the
	// rule tier cannot read (gem-agent ADR-0077).
	//
	// What it buys is narrow and deliberate: no standing shortcut
	// answers such a call. A session allowlist and a `never` policy were
	// both written for a session with no ceiling, and the ceiling is the
	// newer, narrower statement — a read-only session ran an allowlisted
	// MCP write with no prompt at all while the banner said it changed
	// nothing (independent review).
	//
	// It does NOT take the call away from the model tier. gem-agent ADR-0080 §5
	// puts the mode in front of that tier on purpose, and it was
	// measured escalating an MCP write and passing an MCP read; making
	// these operator-only would remove the judgment the ADR chose and
	// stop every lookup in a read-only session. §5 is a judgment, §3 is
	// the kernel denial, and the ADR says not to blur them — the
