// PurposeArg is the reserved argument every approval-gated tool takes:
// the model's one-sentence declaration of why the call is needed
// (gem-agent ADR-0047). Gemini 3 practically never writes a preamble as a text
// part when it calls a tool — 1 turn in 349, measured — so the
// motivation lived only in the thought stream, which is display-only
// and wiped the moment the round ends in a call. This field is the
// place where intent is written down.
//
// It is lagent's field, not the tool's contract: stripped before the
// tool runs, kept in the history (replay fidelity), and never evidence
// for any gate.
//
// The name is namespaced deliberately. A bare "purpose" is an ordinary
// English word that any MCP server may already use for an argument of
// its own, and a collision degrades SILENTLY: lagent stands down and
// that tool alone loses its declaration — on a third-party tool, which
// is exactly where an operator most needs to know why a call is being
// made. Prefixing costs a few tokens per gated tool in a cached prompt
// prefix and makes the collision path effectively unreachable. The
// stand-down in gatedForPurpose stays as the guard for the case this
// name does not cover.
