// fact: show_image once promised "PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, HEIC" — view_image's
// list, which is about what the MODEL can read — while this package decodes
// two of them, so three kinds of file were accepted, read, and then always
// refused at the draw. TestFormatsAreWhatDecodes holds the two together.

// MaxBytes is the ceiling on a decoded image (ADR-0021 §4). Measured on
// the counter the emit path uses: physicalRows costs about 3.6 ms per MiB
// and the payload string is held in three places at once — the emit path,
// Bubble Tea's queued-message buffer and the terminal's scrollback — so
// the JSON-RPC frame cap's ~7.5 MiB would cost four times this.
//
// It is a ceiling, not a target: the picture is scaled into a box of at
// most a screenful of cells, so a larger original is pixels the terminal
// discards.

// roughly 8x18 device pixels, so one row is worth about 2.25 columns of
// picture. This chooses how a box is SHAPED and never how it is counted —
// a wrong constant letterboxes the picture inside a box the terminal
// reserves whole (ADR-0020), it does not move the row count.

// draw it at all. A block whose MIME claims an image but whose bytes do
// not decode is not one: DecodeConfig is the validator, and it reads only
// the header rather than the picture.
