// Package termimg draws an image into the terminal's own cells inside a box
// the caller DECLARES (ADR-0020).
//
// The declaration is the whole point. The TUI counts the physical rows of
// every line it prints and the bottom pinning rests on that count, but an
// image payload measures zero cells wide to every surface the TUI has —
// ansi.StringWidth returns 0 for all of these escapes — so physicalRows
// credits an image line with the one row it floors to while the terminal
// advances N. Measured on two terminals with a plain control at the same
// fill: once the screen is full, a terminal that draws what the counter
// cannot see strands one frame per image in the scrollback.
//
// So the counter is never asked to measure. The caller chooses a Box, the
// payload declares it, and Box.Rows is the number emit adds — in place of
// the floor of 1, never in addition to it. Both dimensions are declared:
// an image wider than the terminal would be wrapped by the terminal itself,
// adding rows the declared height never claimed, so Fit clamps the columns
// before the payload is built.
//
// Only protocols that can declare a row count are here. Sixel cannot, and
// is not supported.
//
