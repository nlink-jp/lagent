// Package mcpfilter answers one question, in one place: is this MCP
// server — or this function of it — excluded from the session's declared
// tools (ADR-0077)?
//
// The whole mechanism is a filter on names applied at two points: the
// declarations the model is given, and the dispatch of a call. This
// package is the predicate. It is pure: loading files belongs to
// internal/config, and the two call sites live in cmd and the executor.
//
// MCP declares no capability to filter on — a Tool is a name, a title, a
// description and schemas, plus optional annotations a client must treat
// as untrusted — so the name is the only expressible form the operator's
// intent has. That bounds what this can be worth: it removes the name,
// not the capability, and a function that returns under a different name
// is a function this package cannot notice.
//
