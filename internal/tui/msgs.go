// Package tui implements the interactive terminal UI (gem-agent ADR-0002):
// Bubble Tea in inline mode — completed conversation flushes to the
// terminal's native scrollback, only the live region (streaming text,
// status, input box) is managed. The agent core stays UI-agnostic; the
// agent goroutine talks to the UI exclusively through Program.Send.
//
// Ported from gem-agent internal/tui at be7609980022e38314268c58ca94a6517e6f5d28 (v0.74.0), ADR-0001.
