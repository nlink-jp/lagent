// SweepWriter sits between Bubble Tea's renderer and the terminal and

// (ADR-0026 C, gem-agent ADR-0094). The terminal re-wraps the frame before
// the model hears of the resize, and Bubble Tea repaints relative to the
// cursor, so those rows would stay on screen as stale copies of the input
// box; the screen clear that used to sweep them lost every picture on the
// screen and piled empty screens into iTerm2's scrollback (measured,
// gem-agent ADR-0094).
//
// Neither of the model's own channels can: a line queued with tea.Println
// is always followed by "\r\n" and so costs a row of history per resize,
// and a prefix in View() is lost when a later view replaces it before the
// tick, or repeated when a repaint sends it again. What the renderer does
// guarantee is its cursor: between flushes it rests at column 0 of the
// region's last line, and every flush of a region taller than one line
// begins with CSI n A, n = linesRendered-1. The writer rewrites the first
// such flush after an arm into CSI n+K A followed by an erase-below — one
// write, from the renderer's own count.
//
// It also tracks which frame was last FLUSHED, because K has to describe
// what is on the screen: the model sees views the renderer may replace
// before a tick ever writes them.
