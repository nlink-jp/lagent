// It exists as a package, rather than as a stretch of runREPL, for two
// reasons. The rule — a line earns a place at startup only if nothing
// else will say it — needs somewhere to be stated and tested as a rule.
// And the operator-text read-through has to be able to render the
// assembled banner: `make labels` collected the fragments and scattered
// them through a flat list, so the one screen every operator meets first
// was the one thing the read-through could not read, which is how these
// lines accumulated to twenty-eight rows in the first place.
