// TestWithdrawnClaimsStayWithdrawn is the mechanism three verification
// passes asked for and three rounds of human re-reading failed to supply.
// The recorded rule is that a withdrawal is counted in the surfaces a
// reader reads, and that the sweep gets a test in the same commit — "a
// withdrawn mechanism disappears from the code, not from the prose".
// Measured cost of not having it: round two swept the instruments and left
// the claim in the documents, round three swept the documents and left it
// in the CHANGELOG, and one round's remedy for a false claim was itself a
// false claim.
//
// A retired phrase may still appear where it is being retired — a record
// that says what it withdrew is doing its job. So an occurrence is allowed
// when the line, or one of the two before it, carries a withdrawal marker.
// Anything else is an assertion of something this project has decided is
// not true.
