# verify-release-selftest: exercise the verify-release gate against a
# synthetic dist, and require it to reject every bad zip.
#
# The gate runs by hand, once, at release time, so a hole in it is
# invisible until it lets something through. One did: `|| true`, written
# for the informational spctl probe, sat at the end of an
# `unzip && --version && spctl` chain and forgave all three, so a zip
# that did not unpack still printed "verify-release: OK"
# (review 2026-09-08, F-04). This runs in `make check`.
#
# The fixture binary is a shell script — what is under test is the
# gate's control flow, not the Go build.
