# the whole doc set at introduction: 55 pairs, 0 differences, and it

# --- a diagram does not close its right edge over CJK -------------------
# A right edge is a column-counting promise, and no amount of padding can
# keep it in a document that mixes CJK with a proportional fallback font.
# Three readings of the same box were tried and all three failed:
#
#   1. pad it as written        — the rows measured 53, 54 and 57 columns
#   2. pad it CJK=2, box=1      — correct under the model internal/tui
#      pins go-runewidth to (AGENTS.md §Gotchas), broken under a CJK
#      locale's, where box drawing and arrows are Ambiguous and go wide
#   3. redraw in ASCII, CJK=2   — still broken in the viewer that
#      reported it: its monospace stack has no CJK, so kana and kanji
#      come from a fallback whose advance is not exactly twice the Latin
#      one. There is no integer padding that fixes a non-integer ratio.
#
# So the rule is not about padding. A framed row — one that both opens
# and closes with an edge — may not contain CJK at all. Left edges,
# indentation and tree stems are ASCII and align under any font; it is
# only the closing edge that has to be earned, and over CJK it cannot
# be. Diagrams with no right edge (the package trees, the ADR-0050
# pipeline, the turn diagram now) have nothing to break.

# and Ambiguous checks below are what it must pass.
