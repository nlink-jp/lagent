// inertStreams makes the command's stdout and stderr inert where each one
// is a terminal, and leaves it alone where it is not (ADR-0024 §3). The
// plain REPL and -p write the model's text to stdout and its tool details,
// approval prompts and questions to stderr; a terminal executes some of
// those bytes, a pipe or a file does not. This is `ls -q` / `ls -w`: the
// host's own convention for text it did not write.
//
// The RFP's contract — stdout carries model text only (§2) — keeps its meaning for
// the reader it was written for: a program reading a pipe gets every byte.
//
// Called once, at the top of runREPL, so every later print is covered
// without knowing it. The TUI writes to the terminal through Bubble Tea,
// not through these streams, and makes its own text inert at its ingress.
