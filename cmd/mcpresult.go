// mcpIntake turns one MCP tool result into what the model sees.
//
// It exists because deciding that a result is too large, or is not text
// at all, is the client's job and was being done in the wrong place.
// Built-in tool results have always been bounded by tools.OutputCap;
// MCP results were passed through whole, so every server in the fleet
// grew a workspace_root of its own to keep from flooding a context it
// cannot measure. A server cannot know the model's context window. This
// side can (ADR-0058).
//
// Nothing is dropped. Text past the cap is written to the session work
// directory and the model is handed a preview and the path — the work
// directory is a root of the file tools, so read_file reaches it.
// Non-text blocks are written the same way; an image comes back as a
// path the model can hand to view_image, which is the deliberate look
// ADR-0012 designed and keeps media out of the replayed history that
// ADR-0027 was written to protect.
